                <h1>IP Addresses</h1>
                <p>An IP address is a unique address that identifies a device on the internet or a local network. IP stands for "Internet Protocol," which is the set of rules governing the format of data sent via the internet or local network.</p>

                <h1>DNS</h1>
                <p>DNS translates domain names to IP addresses so browsers can load Internet resources. Each device connected to the Internet has a unique IP address which other machines use to find the device. DNS servers eliminate the need for humans to memorize IP addresses such as 192.168.</p>

                <h1>Packets (TCP/UDP)</h1>
                <p>TCP data units are known as packets. UDP data units are commonly referred to as datagrams (although they're sometimes called packets as well). TCP rearranges data packets to be received in their intended order. UDP sends datagrams independently, meaning that they may arrive in a different order.</p>

                        <h1>HTTP</h1>
                        <p>Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-layer protocol for transmitting hypermedia documents, such as HTML. It was designed for communication between web browsers and web servers, but it can also be used for other purposes.</p>

                        <p>A router is a switching device for networks, which is able to route network packets, based on their addresses, to other networks or devices. Among other things, they are used for Internet access, for coupling networks or for connecting branch offices to a central office via VPN (Virtual Private Network).</p>
